## Entry Condition

GDD at `.claude/docs/production/gdd/<SystemName>.md` must exist and be approved. If missing, call `/regress "Design <SystemName> GDD" "GDD required before coding"`.

---

## Steps

1. Read all input docs in the order listed above
2. **Verify editor state** — call `get_unity_editor_state` and `list_game_objects_in_hierarchy`
3. **Check existing scripts** — call `list_files` on `Assets/Scripts/`
4. **Write script(s)** — write `Assets/Scripts/<SystemName>.cs` per the GDD
   - One script per responsibility — never merge two responsibilities into one file
   - Apply every rule from `best-practices.md` exactly
   - Respect all performance budgets from `technical-preferences.md`
5. **Compile check** — call `check_compile_errors`; fix all errors before continuing
6. **Wire scene** — place GameObjects, assign component references, set transforms per the GDD
7. **Save** — call `save_scene`
8. **Test** — call `play_game`, observe console, call `stop_game`; fix any issues and re-test until clean
9. **Update snapshot** — run `GenerateProjectSnapshot.Execute()` via `execute_script`
10. **Tick PIPELINE.md** — change `- [ ] <SystemName>` to `- [x] <SystemName>`; if all systems in a tier are now checked, tick that tier's milestone line too

---

## Exit Condition

`play_game` test passes with no errors. PIPELINE.md item ticked. Snapshot updated.

---

## Constraints

- Never start coding without reading the GDD first
- Never tick PIPELINE.md before `play_game` passes
